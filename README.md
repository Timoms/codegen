# codegen
University Project for explaining a codegenerator (part of compiler).
Its created with C# as a console application. 

The main goal is to show the audience how assembly code is generated out of three-adress-code. 

The code.exe accepts a file called 'z.dat' in the root of the project. 
Its filled with three-adress-code, one per line. 

Example:

p:=3
q:=p+4
